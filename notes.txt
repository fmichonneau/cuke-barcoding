For the manual delineation, we take current IDs at face value.
* untested -- we see genetic differences but can't say if morphology is different (only when we have genus level ID)
* different -- there is different names
* started the same - species level ID, but in fact multiple ESUs
  - we looked a little we didn't find anything (no access to material, difficult group)
  - we looked a lot we didn't find anything
  - we looked and we found something

use letters for ESUs only differentiated by genetic data
use numbers to indicate ESUs that are different morphologically as well
